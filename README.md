# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Analysis Overview
The goal of this project is to examine and categorize the success of charitable donations using deep-learning neural networks and the TensorFlow framework in Python.
For the analysis, we employ the following methods:
- Preprocessing the data for the neural network model,
- Compile, train and evaluate the model,
- Optimize the model
## Results
### Data Preprocessing

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
